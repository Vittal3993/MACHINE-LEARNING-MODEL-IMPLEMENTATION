# MACHINE-LEARNING-MODEL-IMPLEMENTATION

Company : Codetech IT solutions

Name : Vittal Mallikarjun Mugali

Intern ID : CT06DY1012

Domain : Python Programming

Duration : 6 weeks

Mentor : Neela santosh

Description of the project :

This project demonstrates the implementation of a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as either spam or ham (not spam) using Python and Scikit-learn. It is part of the internship deliverables for Codetech IT Solutions Pvt. Ltd., under the domain of Python Programming.

The model uses the SMS Spam Collection Dataset, a widely used benchmark dataset for text classification tasks. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorization, model training using Multinomial Naive Bayes, and performance evaluation through metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix.

Objectives:

Build a predictive model using Scikit-learn

Apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for text classification

Evaluate model performance using standard metrics

Showcase implementation in a clean, modular Jupyter Notebook

Technologies Used:

Python

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy Score

Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

Confusion Matrix Visualization

Custom Message Prediction
